# Project Overview:

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems has become a hit. Many people are using bike sharing system to rent bikes for short term basis for leisure or health. Through this project, I will be using the data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider to uncover bike share usage patterns for three major cities across United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

The following statistical analysis have been done using the datasets(.csv files) provided for the mentioned cities. 


 

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)


#3 Trip duration

* total travel time
* average travel time


#4 User info

* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
